Like my father before, I have traveled to major cities in Asia.

Also, I relied on my company and the business trips to take me to these destinations.

I have enjoyed all of my travels.

Regret that I didn't prepare and appreciate travel during my 30s and 40s.

Visited Japan during my 30s and 50s.

Much more preparation and appreciation in my later life.
