Of all the cities visited in Japan, most memorable is 鎌倉市 (Kamakura City).

Its combination of temples and shrines that rival any larger destinations.

Its man made buildings co-exist with nature.

It is also hard to distinguish new from the old.
Where nature starts and man-made boundaries end.

The spirit of old Kamakura Period pervades the town.

### Reflections at a Restaurant

Saw a gentleman in a reflective mood.

At that time, thought to myself, he looks very old.

(not many years later, I am approaching his age)

- Perhaps he was recalling earlier in life when he visited Kamakura with his young wife.
- Recalling a business venture that didn't go as planned.
- Thinking of an old friend that recently passed away.

### Time as an ally

There have been periods in my life, when I wished for time to slow down.

- Savor the stay at Asian countries that I always wished to visit.
- When my team wins a match at the World Cup, at the last minute of the match.
- Reach a vista captured by renowned artists.

In equal measure, there have been times, especially some nights, seemingly will not end.

Mercifully all these times have passed and I have grown from those experiences.

- What lessons do I recall from earlier generations?
- What memories will future generations have of us?

### Preparations for a visit

Regret that I didn't prepare and appreciate travel during my 30s and 40s.

Visited Japan during my 30s and 50s.

Much more preparation and appreciation in my later life.
