## Ward Conference Notes

Bishop Barker and President Reeves spoke

### Bishop Barker

Like Math Formula, if A=B and B=C then it must be that A=C
If i love God and God loves others, then I must also love others.

Share the good things in life with others

We are perfectly positioned by who is Perfect

### President Reeves - Music can nurture us

Was asked to sing in public on his mission.
Was not comfortable singing in public

Was thinking it was for and about me.
It was for a grieving young couple who just lost their newborn child.

He sang `Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide` at the cemetery and no longer thought of himself nor heard the truck noise.

Lay aside distractions in life

## Priesthood Lesson by a High Councilman

`How do we find happiness`

## First Brother

Parents separated at 15, to live their own lives.
Was on his own.

Grandfather gave 8000 in 1978 (roughly 37,000 today)
Bought a car and went on a mission with that money

A son died at childbirth, he was 23 years old at the time
Needed to console his wife.

Needed help.

He was like that young couple, one that lost child and President Reeves sang the hymn.

## Second Brother

For a while in his life.
His partner was loneliness and resentment 
Then the music changed, a new parter appeared

This time acceptance rather than resentment or loneliness

He was addicted to drugs

All through his experience, throuogh the undercurrent of reality or difficult situation, there was benevolence

Here overcame his addiction through the help of 12 steps^[

- We admitted we were powerless over alcohol-that our lives had become unmanageable.
- Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
- Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.

Peace in Christ, Philippians 4:7

> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
