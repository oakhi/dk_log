> Got up at 7:30.. Been snowing since last night. Snow up in the mountain. Where we live, snow has melted.

> Didn't go out, waited for the son. Son came with Min and Chan.

> Together, went to the restaurant. Helped with dishes and sliced meat afterwards.

> Today was a good day -- for business. I am grateful.

> Came home at 9:30, brought back items to fertilize the garden.
