Stake President Reeves spoke about the role of hymns in our lives.

He was a new missionary in Oklahoma.

His trainer said that they will be singing in public.

President Reeves said,

> I don't sing in public.

When he arrived at the site of the singing, he changed his decision.
He realized, the singing wasn't about him.

They were to sing for a young couple who just lost their child.
To give meaning to their loss.

They sang, `Abide with me`


1. Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;

The darkness deepens. Lord, with me abide!

When other helpers fail and comforts flee,

Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day.

Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away.

Change and decay in all around I see;

O thou who changest not, abide with me!

3. I need thy presence ev’ry passing hour.

What but thy grace can foil the tempter’s pow’r?

Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?

Thru cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me!

Text: Henry F. Lyte, 1793–1847

Music: William H. Monk, 1823–1889
