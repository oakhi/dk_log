Learned that our neighbor, Brother Reese H., had a heart attack last Sunday.

I saw the ambulance during the snowstorm, but thought it was a traffic accident, rather than a medical emergency.

Heard that 4 stents were placed and he is home and recovering.

Need to be careful, as one ages.

## Tinka's Message

Sister Tinka E. gave a great message about how adversity builds us.

She talked about her idyllic childhood in Burbank and how good it was to have examples of older siblings, she had 8 siblings, that went to BYU.

She married a wonderful man, who was a son of a Stake President.

After having 3 sons, their marriage ended in divorce.

She asked her mother, why she wasn't given a blessing of a large family.
Her mother, Sister Smith, told her to be patient.

She also said,

> Adversity is an opportunity for us to grow up

Her criteria for her husband was,

- Keep the commandments of God
- Faitfully exercise the priesthood 
- Likes to travel

Later she met a men with 5 children and had 2 more children together.

Brother Eliason ran a company called, Heritage Tours.  Tour that took members to various church historic sites, mainly in the East^[https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/legacy/obituary.aspx?n=robert-eliason&pid=187205840&fhid=6221].

## Tyler Moulton on Embodiment

He said he prepared 75 pages of notes -- single spaced.  Then he pulled out a one-page version to talk about.

He began by stating the two-fold purpose of church attendance.

> Maintenance vs. Growth

He mentioned there are many `Book of Mormon` scriptures that lists various attributes but they mostly end with,

> "...endure to the end"

Also comparing to the Bull Riding; it can be compared to Hanging-On vs Progress.

Another comparison might be River Raft rider; Effort vs. Experience

Then he a bit technical; discussing various usage of term `Soul`

Genesis 2:7 

> 7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

Compared to Moses 3:7

> 7 And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.

yet another, Abraham 5:7

> 7 And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his cspirit (that is, the manâ€™s spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living dsoul.

He then moved to consciousness or the mind of man.

Mentioned a book `After` by Bruce Greyson. ^[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/after-bruce-greyson/1136900814]

Certainly an enlightening discussion.  Some of it was bit beyond my comprehension.

## A visit with Dr. Richard Thomas

He stopped to say sorry for the death of my mother.
He then described the death of his own father.  Apparently he fell in the bathroom.  The emergency crew had to break the door to help him. By then it was too late and he passed away.

He was worried about the government taking freedom away from citizens.

He also mentioned that there is a transition of soul from this life to the next life.

## Family of Tyler Moulton

There is a family in the ward, Moultons.

Then they invited their parents Rex and Jacqueline Dansie Moulton into the Ward.

Afterwards, Youngs moved into the Ward. Michelle Young is their oldest daugher.

Latest to move into the Ward are Wheatleys, Dayna is their second daughter. They live with Jacqueline in the basement.

-   Michelle Young (Steve),
-   Jaret Moulton (Melissa), lives in the Edgemont area of Provo
-   Dayna Wheatley (Micah),
-   Tyler Moulton (Heather)^[https://www.deseret.com/2013/1/3/20719155/obituary-moulton-rex]

I have worked with Warren Dansie, who is Jacqueline's youngest brother. 
When Byron Dansie was introduced in the church, I coult tell he was a Dansie.

[so I basically invited myself to their family gathering, when Byron said Warren will be there]

I had a great time visiting Jaret Moulton, older brother of Tyler.

He talked about how the family of 6 went to New Zealand when Tyler was 3.

They went there relying on the skill of their father Rex, who was 41.

For the first year, he took on jobs available.
Then the family prayed for divine guidance and help.

The church hired Rex to finish 4 church buildings.
That allowed the family to stay in New Zealand for 4 years.

When it was time for the Moulton family to come home, they asked for the cash equivalent of their return trip.

With that money, they traveled for 6 months to Europe, via Australia and South Africa on a ship.

When they reached Holland, they rented a van and traveled all of Europe as a family.

Showed Warren, Dad's photo from Vietnam and his Journal.  They agreed it was blessing.

His neighbor, that he came with, talked about how she saw an old photo of her mother when she was in Burma (Myanmar).  It was when she was 16.  She had never seen a picture of her mother when she was young^[His neighbor is from Bolton, England]. 

## Remodelling of Ludlow home by Moultons

Front part of the house was not modified.
Brother Moulton added windows to the west of the house.
