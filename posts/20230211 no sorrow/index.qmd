> Been cold all day, made it difficult
Invited by daughter-in-law's sister
Went over with New Year's Cash on hand
Enjoyed the meal and handed out cash to 14 persons

> One more addition to the family
Sam, grand daughter's fiance spent time with us

> Not much got done.  Knitted 3 more dish washing tool.  Older I get more to do, but no energy
Life at times seems without purpose

> Fell asleep wondering what to do this year
