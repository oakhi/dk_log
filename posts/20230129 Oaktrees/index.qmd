Mook is made by grinding and adding emulsifier.

There are store bought versions but we like to make our own.

Between the BYU Law Building and the Wilkinson Center there are mature acorn trees (Oak Trees).

When our children were younger, we'd take a trip to BYU and pick fallen acorns to make the dish

Children would yell,

>"I see Acorns"

People must have wondered what we were doing.

Even some 25 years later, I remember with fondness, those days of picking Acorns and turning them into an edible dish.

## Steps of Making a 도토리묵

According one source, eating 도토리묵 was a sign of poverty.  

In the old days, when there wasn't enough food, people used to eat acorn jelly, since eat didn't need to be grown, but readily available.

Now days, it is not eaten, not so much as a food, but as a delicacy.  
And perhaps, nostalgia, about survival and making something edible that nature provided each season.
