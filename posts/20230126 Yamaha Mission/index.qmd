## Mission 717 Speakers

### Description^[https://www.hifiengine.com/manual_library/mission/717.shtml]
The 717 is a brand new addition to the Mission range, Here, the greatest challenge to our design team was to ensure a significant advance over the 700, which has presented genuine competition to many models costing substantially more.
Mission 717's will now set a completely new standard of quality in their price category and will be one of our most formidable products for the 1980's.
It offers a rare combination of accuracy, low colouration, high dynamic range, high efficiency and high power handling.

## Impressions

Clarity and spectrum of sound absent from modern day equipment.

Compared to Mission, other sound reproducing speakers sound somewhat muffled or aggregated over a certain frequency.

>A permanent bias toward higher frequency on the graphic equalizer

## Listening Modes

Listen to FM Stations, some trouble locking in weaker stations.

`Auto DX` vs. `Local` seems to make no real difference
Not sure about the function of `REC CAL`
Could use MANUAL Tuning Mode, in case signals are weak.

> This combo makes oldies station sound better than modern music stations.
