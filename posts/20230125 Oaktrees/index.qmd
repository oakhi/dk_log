도토리묵 can be bought in stores or made at home.

Between the BYU Law Building and the Wilkinson Center there are mature acorn trees (Oak Trees).

When our children were younger, we'd take a trip to BYU and pick fallen acorns to make the dish

Children would yell,

> "I see Acorns over there"

People must have wondered what we were doing.

The amount of effort, to pick acorns, peeling the shell, and grinding and boiling until firm, doesn't add up.

However, sometimes, there is something about re-creating food that ancestors ate and try to replicate the work they put it -- before automation and specialization set in.

Even some 25 years later, as I walk past those oak trees, those days of picking Acorns and turning them into an edible dish.

## Steps of Making a 도토리묵

According one source, eating 도토리묵 was a sign of poverty.

In the old days, when there wasn't enough food, people used to eat acorn jelly, since eat didn't need to be grown, but readily available.

Now days, it is not eaten, not so much as a food, but as a delicacy.\
And perhaps, nostalgia, about survival and making something edible that nature provided each season.
