During my time at Los Angeles as a missionary, we seldom received referrals from the Church

So it was a great surprise when we were told to visit the Kang family in Beverly Hills.

Kangs visited the Temple Square, on their visit to Yellowstone.

We were cordially invited to their home.

They served us a fresh squeezed grapefruit juice.

Maybe the environment, a simple home in a coveted neighborhood.

Or the company, a professionally established Korean in America.

I sensed my inadequacy in talking with this family.

We introduced gospel to them and they listened and asked some clarifying questions.

We could sense that they were not going to commit.

Like Nicodemus in New Testament that asked about being born again,

> Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God

We need to

-   know and understand the doctrine.

-   own the role in the plan of salvation

-   live the plan of happiness

-   let the plan of happiness and the gospel be part of you.

-   be swallowed up in the plan along with our will.

Kang family gave us a goal to achieve in this life.

Be independent, truth seeking family.

Need to go beyond and be born again and again.
