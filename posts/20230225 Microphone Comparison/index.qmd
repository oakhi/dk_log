Bishop mentioned the concept of `Healer's Art`.

Refer to a talk given at a BYU Devotional, by Elaine
Marshall^[https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/elaine-s-marshall/learning-healers-art/].

> Such secret healing is not a single event. It happens as a process of
> living. You cannot simply take off a day or start tomorrow like a new
> diet and return healed. It happens quietly while you face the pain. It
> happens over time as you live, work, study, and give to others.

Bishop is a surgeon.

He took the road to learning the `Healer's Art`, when then Apostle
Russell M. Nelson, encouraged young people to consider the path towards
a Medical Doctor.

Thought of my parents stay in Utah.

Not only did they expressed their happiness in living their retirement days in Utah but it also extended their lives.

Through dedication and care of skilled surgeon and my parents were able to overcome the effects subdural
hematomas^[https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21183-subdural-hematoma] and gradual failure of renal functions.

> I would be my brother’s keeper;
I would learn the healer’s art.
To the wounded and the weary
I would show a gentle heart.
I would be my brother’s keeper—
Lord, I would follow thee.

Went up to the front and told the congregation, how grateful that my parents were able to live out their last days among them.

Felt comfortable standing in the front.

To think, I did this regularly for the past 5 years.
