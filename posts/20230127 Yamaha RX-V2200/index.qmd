Appreciated living in an area, few hundred feet higher than some.

It is possible to receive FM ^[Frequency Modulation] signals without the use of antennas.

From early age, radio has been a part of my family.

Before starting school, I remembered, I won a contest.

I was entered by my uncle, along with the whole family.

The moment my name was called on the radio was exciting. My uncle tossed me about and congratulated me.

I remember we went to the radio station to pick up the prize.

By the time, fees and taxes were paid, think we had enough for a meal at a Chinese Restaurant.

## FM Radio Stations

[FM Broadcasting]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting)

Listened to my share of Top 40 and Album Rock stations during teenage years.

Biggest news was when the local Rock Station DC-101, WWDC-AM/FM, hired Howard Stern

Since mission days and intervening years in Provo, the station most listened to has been KBYU-FM, Classical 89.

Of all the formats available, including CDs, Cassettes, Reel to Reel, Minidisc, and even streaming, the FM is still my choice for music and information.

Because it requires minimal intervention, once one finds that station.

It is a good the signals are strong in my neighborhood.

## FM Transmission Systems

> Ideally, the antenna for an FM
broadcast station would be situated at a
location that would present a clear line-ofsight to the entirety of the desired service
area. The antenna would have uniform
horizontal- and vertical-plane radiation
patterns, and there would be no reflections
from natural or manmade objects.

A complicated unit to master

Changing between CD and CD-R side is not intuitive

The backside has both analog and digital inputs and outputs.

In addition to digital coaxial output connections, there is a SPDIF input to the CD-R side.
