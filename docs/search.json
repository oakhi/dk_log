Where nature starts and man-made boundaries end.\nThe spirit of old Kamakura Period pervades the town.\n\n\n\nRoad to Enlightenment\n\n\n\nReflections at a Restaurant\nSaw a gentleman in a reflective mood.\nAt that time, thought to myself, he looks very old.\n(not many years later, I am approaching his age)\n\nPerhaps he was recalling earlier in life when he visited Kamakura with his young wife.\nRecalling a business venture that didn’t go as planned.\nThinking of an old friend that recently passed away.\n\n\n\n\nKita Kamakura Restaurant\n\n\nやま本きそば\n\n\nTime as an ally\nThere have been periods in my life, when I wished for time to slow down.\n\nSavor the stay at Asian countries that I always wished to visit.\nWhen my team wins a match at the World Cup, at the last minute of the match.\nReach a vista captured by renowned artists.\n\nIn equal measure, there have been times, especially some nights, seemingly will not end.\nMercifully all these times have passed and I have grown from those experiences.\n\nWhat lessons do I recall from earlier generations?\nWhat memories will future generations have of us?\n\n\n\nPreparations for a visit\nRegret that I didn’t prepare and appreciate travel during my 30s and 40s.\nVisited Japan during my 30s and 50s.\nMuch more preparation and appreciation in my later life."

Mission 717’s will now set a completely new standard of quality in their price category and will be one of our most formidable products for the 1980’s. It offers a rare combination of accuracy, low colouration, high dynamic range, high efficiency and high power handling.\n\nThe Mission 717 is part of a range of four speakers produced in the late 1970s early 1980s, consisting of the 700, 717, 727 and 770\n\n\nFrom AudioKarma4\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nType: 2 way, 2 driver loudspeaker system\nFrequency Response: 55Hz to 20kHz\nRecommended Amplifier: 15 to 100W\nImpedance: 8Ω\nSensitivity: 92dB\nBass: 1 x 210mm reinforced cone\nTweeter: 1 x 25mm damped dome\nEnclosure: bass reflex\nFinish: walnut, black ash\nDimensions: 515 x 277 x 270mm\nWeight: 8.5kg"
