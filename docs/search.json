Tenth Street School, at Olympic and Grattan, was founded in 1888 and has kept the original name.

Thank you Sister From The Thorny Place.\nThen Ashlene, got up and related her therapy experience and how it taught her about identity.\nThe therapist ask her,\n\n“Who are you?”\n\nShe thought about it for a while and she realized that this is where she was taught to say,\n\n“I am a child of God!”\n\nThis experience gave her additional insight into the Plan of Happiness\nThen Ron R., who is 88, used his cane to get up to the front.\nThen he told a story about how he needed a new carpet for his basement. But he was also asked to prepare for 3 years of food storage.\nHe debated which one to follow, since they were mutually exclusive.\nHe decided to follow the teachings of the leaders.\nShortly thereafter, a neighbor also carpeted their house.\nHowever, the cat and the carpet couldn’t co-exist, so the neighbor gave a brand new carpet to Brother R for free.\n(Brother R told me afterwards, that he has been home from his mission for 65 years. He served in the Central America Mission, which was split from the Mexico Mission)\n____\nNormally, I would have gone home after the first hour.\nBut I stayed and the teacher, who also teaches seminary gave a wonderfully prepared lesson.\nFound this verse that is applicable for me.\n\nThe people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.\n\nWhich is quoted in Matthew, Chapter 4,\n14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,\n15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;\n16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.\n17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\nThe teacher and the class were discussing the 3 temptations of the devil.\nThought how we sell our birthright for something that is temporary and that is worth far less.\nLike how Esau, sold his birthright to Isaac.\nGive in to temporal needs rather than let the spiritual part of us take charge.\nTruman Madsen2 quoted Brigham Young3,\n\nThe spirit is pure, and under the special control and influence of the Lord. . . .\n\n\nRecollect, brethren and sisters, everyone of you, that when evil is suggested to you, when it arises in your hearts, it is through the temporal organization. When you are tempted, buffetted, and step out of the way inadvertently; when you are overtaken in a fault, or commit an overt act unthinkingly; when you are full of evil passion, and wish to yield to it, then stop and let [that’s different than make; it presupposes that the spirit wants this] the spirit, which God has put into your tabernacles, take the lead. If you do that, I will promise that you will overcome all evil, and obtain eternal lives. But many, very many, let the spirit yield to the body, and are overcome and destroyed. [JD 2:256]\n\n\nMet Blaine W. who used to be Stake Cub Scout Leader. (or maybe served 2 combined Wards as a leader).\nTold him about our youngest and we visited and thanked him for his effort.\n\n\n\n28 October 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n18 November 2008\n\n\n___\nGlad I attended the early Ward meeting.\nI didn’t recognize their faces and names, but it seemed like I have sensed the same spirit that they exhibited — over the years.\nSaw Brother Tom H. as well as David & Cherie H., parents of Sarah H.\n\nMade some Spring Rolls as a family. It is not so much making rolls but visiting and chatting as we worked.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nYoung Single Adults 18-30 years of age↩︎\na former Patriarch of the Provo Sharon East Stake↩︎\n20 September 1994, https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/truman-g-madsen/know/↩︎"
