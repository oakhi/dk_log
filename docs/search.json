He served in the Central America Mission, which was split from the Mexico Mission)\n____\nNormally, I would have gone home after the first hour.\nBut I stayed and the teacher, who also teaches seminary gave a wonderfully prepared lesson.\nFound this verse that is applicable for me.\n\nThe people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.\n\nWhich is quoted in Matthew, Chapter 4,\n14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,\n15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;\n16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.\n17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\nThe teacher and the class were discussing the 3 temptations of the devil.\nThought how we sell our birthright for something that is temporary and that is worth far less.\nLike how Esau, sold his birthright to Isaac.\nGive in to temporal needs rather than let the spiritual part of us take charge.\nTruman Madsen2 quoted Brigham Young3,\n\nThe spirit is pure, and under the special control and influence of the Lord. . . .\n\n\nRecollect, brethren and sisters, everyone of you, that when evil is suggested to you, when it arises in your hearts, it is through the temporal organization. When you are tempted, buffetted, and step out of the way inadvertently; when you are overtaken in a fault, or commit an overt act unthinkingly; when you are full of evil passion, and wish to yield to it, then stop and let [that’s different than make; it presupposes that the spirit wants this] the spirit, which God has put into your tabernacles, take the lead. If you do that, I will promise that you will overcome all evil, and obtain eternal lives. But many, very many, let the spirit yield to the body, and are overcome and destroyed. [JD 2:256]\n\n\nMet Blaine W. who used to be Stake Cub Scout Leader. (or maybe served 2 combined Wards as a leader).\nTold him about our youngest and we visited and thanked him for his effort.\n\n\n\n28 October 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n18 November 2008\n\n\n___\nGlad I attended the early Ward meeting.\nI didn’t recognize their faces and names, but it seemed like I have sensed the same spirit that they exhibited — over the years.\nSaw Brother Tom H. as well as David & Cherie H., parents of Sarah H.\n\nMade some Spring Rolls as a family. It is not so much making rolls but visiting and chatting as we worked.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nYoung Single Adults 18-30 years of age↩︎\na former Patriarch of the Provo Sharon East Stake↩︎\n20 September 1994, https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/truman-g-madsen/know/↩︎"

    "text": "Mike Bateman’s Message\nJohn 20\n\n11 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,\n12 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.\n14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\n15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.\n16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.\n\nI add my testimony to Mary's and to both his ancient and modern day disciples \nHe is risen.\nThose three words are the words of eternal hope \nIn the Savior's brief encounter with Mary He asks her an important question\nWhom seekest thou?\nBrothers and sisters this is the Easter question.\nOf course Mary was seeking Jesus\nIs the first and foremost person that we are seeking in our lives is Jesus?\nDo we, like Mary, sometimes struggle to recognize Him in the challenges of our lives\nIn order that we might recognize Him as we seek, we must come to know Him.\nI pray that the Holy Ghost will help us.\nThis Easter season come to know Jesus in a more deep and personal way\nIf the Easter question is,Whom seekest thou, then the Easter answer is Jesus.\nOver the past several years Cheryl and I, and in a more concentrated way, over the last six months, have been striving to come to know the Savior by studying and learning about his many names, titles and descriptions.\nIn John 14:6, we read  \n\n6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\n\nJesus is the Way\nIn his talk titled, The Way,  Elder Lawrence Corbridge said^[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/10/the-way?lang=eng],\nJesus Christ is the way, there is only one way to happiness and fulfillment he is the way every other way any other way whatever way is foolishness.\nEither we learn of him and have life more abundantly or we don’t and foolishly remain dead still.\nHe is the savior \nEither we accept the blessings of His atonement than are made clean and pure worthy to have this spirit or we don’t and foolishly remain alone in filthy still.\nHe is the way \nTo my young 15 and 16 year old friends in our Sunday school class.\nYou will remember that we spoke of the doctrine of Christ a few weeks ago \nFaith in the Lord Jesus Christ, His atonement, repentance, the keeping and making and keeping of sacred covenants, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost and then remaining in staying with him who is the end \nPlease know that His doctrine is the only way that leads to Him who is the way \nPresident Nelson has further taught that the pure doctrine of Christ is powerful and changes the life of everyone who understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life \nThe doctrine of Christ helps us find and stay on the covenant path and staying on that straight and narrow path that leads us to the Way will ultimately qualify us to receive all that God has. \nBrothers and sisters remember our Easter question, whom seekest thou \nAs we search for, learn about, applied to, and ultimately attain an understanding of the doctrine of Christ.\nAs found in the scriptures and specially in the Book of Mormon we will come to know that Jesus is the Lamb the only enduring and absolute way\nJesus is the Truth\nAgain I wish to speak to my young friends \nPlease know that the Lord Jesus Christ and our heavenly father love you.\nYou are literally a child of God \nPlease know that this is an absolute and eternal truth \nYou may hear some of the world say \nI have my truth and he or she has theirs \nOr it’s up to each individual to say what is true \nOr what makes something true to me is how I feel about it and different people feel differently about things and so what’s true for one person isn’t necessarily true for another \nThese are the philosophies and doctrines of men and they hold no eternal value \nIf one puts their trust in these philosophies they will find themselves tossed with every wind of doctrine \nThe only way to have peace is to be anchored to He who is true \nTruth is found for seeking Jesus \nTo find the answer to our Easter question \nWhom seekest thou \nI invite us to heed and follow God’s living prophet \nAs we do so we’ve learned that Jesus is the truth, the only enduring and absolute truth.\nJesus is the life \nMany years ago Cheryl and I had the opportunity to visit the Holy Land \nIt was during spring time and the flowers were in bloom \nOne of the stops on our trip was the garden of Gethsemane \nBeginning in the Gethsemane and finishing on the cross of Calvary \nJesus alone took upon Himself the pains, the afflictions, the temptations, and the sins of all mankind\nIn order that He may lose the bands of death which bind his people.\nOn the day we arrived we were astonished to find that the garden of Gethsemane was covered in red poppy flowers\nHundreds of these red flowers dotted the ground at the base of the olive tree\nThese red flowers were beautifully symbolic of the life giving blood.\nThe blood cometh from every pore.\nFrom Him who gave His life that you and might live.\nWe took a picture in the garden of Gethsemane\nIt hangs on our wall to remind us who is the giver of life\nI brought it with me today.\n![](poppies.jpeg)\n\n16 For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;\n17 But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;\n18 Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink\n\nI testify that He did not shrink\nBrothers and sisters,\nWhom seekest thou?\nIn the midst of pains, afflictions, temptations\nWhom seekest thou?\nWhen your heart is broken, because you lost someone you love,\nWhom seekest thou?\nWhen you feel that your mistakes, your sins somehow disqualify you from the love of God\nWhom seekest thou?\nWhen you have sincere questions that have not been answered\nWhom seekest thou?\nWhen you are sad, discouraged, or worried over loved ones who have wandered and have lost their way.\nWhom seekest thou?\nWhen you feel anxiety, depression, distress, or perhaps you are overwhelmed by the confusing messages of the world.\n`Whom seekest thou?`\nFor the promise of everlasting life in the face of illness, disability, old age and mortality's inevitable consequence of death.\nAs we are faithful to the life-giving covenant that bind us to Him, we find that our Easter answer to these questions is Jesus.\nJesus is the life.\nI close with one last name.\nRepairer of the breach\nJesus knows, and intimately aware of every breach in my life\nHe knows my weaknesses, He knows my sins, He knows my fears, He knows my inadequacies.\nHe stands ready to repair, to heal and to make me whole.\nThe key for me is to come unto Him, to seek Him.\nI love him with all my heart\nBrothers and sisters I testify that Jesus Christ is risen \nHe is the way, the truth, and the life\nHe is the repairer of every breach \nHe is who we seek, even Jesus Christ"
